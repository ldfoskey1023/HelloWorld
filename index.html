<p>I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help other build something amazing! Whether that’s being a developer or a systems admin, that is my sweet spot. I enjoy learning, so being a developer enables me to flex my education muscles in the right role for me, that’s whay I really enjoy books.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things to do is traveling - even if I don’t go on the tours, just walking around the park and loving God is enough for me 😃</p>

<h1 id="my-favorite-books">My Favorite Books</h1>
<p>I absolutely LOVE the Bible, it is so engaging and rich. What is even better is the church that has formed around it. Lately, I’ve been listening to sermons that do deep dives in the entire Bible and it is so much fun!</p>
