<p>I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help other build something amazing! Whether thatâ€™s being a developer or a systems admin, that is my sweet spot. I enjoy learning, so being a developer enables me to flex my education muscles in the right role for me, thatâ€™s whay I really enjoy books.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things to do is traveling - even if I donâ€™t go on the tours, just walking around the park and loving God is enough for me ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

<h1 id="my-favorite-books">My Favorite Books</h1>
<p>I absolutely LOVE the Bible, it is so engaging and rich. What is even better is the church that has formed around it. Lately, Iâ€™ve been listening to sermons that do deep dives in the entire Bible and it is so much fun!</p>
