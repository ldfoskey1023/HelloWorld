# HelloWorld
This is my first repository! This pull request is to add some descriptions and a headshot to my README.

# A little insight into me
Hi Everyone! My name is Peanut and I am the owner of this branch. This README will give you a bit of information about me!

# My Career Passions
I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help other build something amazing! Whether thatâ€™s being a developer or a systems admin, that is my sweet spot. I enjoy learning, so being a developer enables me to flex my education muscles in the right role for me, thatâ€™s whay I really enjoy books.

# My Hobbles
One of my favorite things to do is traveling - even if I donâ€™t go on the tours, just walking around the park and loving God is enough for me ðŸ˜ƒ

# My Favorite Books
I absolutely LOVE the Bible, it is so engaging and rich. What is even better is the church that has formed around it. Lately, Iâ€™ve been listening to sermons that do deep dives in the entire Bible and it is so much fun!
